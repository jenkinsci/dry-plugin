<p>Hudson understands <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html">PMD's
Copy Paste Detector (CPD)</a> analysis report XML format. When this option
is configured and your build runs the maven goal <code>pmd:cpd</code>
then Hudson provides useful information about analysis results, such as
historical result trend, module and package statistics, web UI for
viewing analysis reports and warnings, and so on.</p>
<p>This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called
for stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
